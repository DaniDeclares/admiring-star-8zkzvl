      <p>Most people think life insurance is something for when you’re old, but that’s one of the biggest financial mistakes you can make. The best time to get coverage is <strong>right now</strong>—while you’re young, healthy, and rates are low.</p>
      <h3>1. It’s Cheaper When You’re Young</h3>
      <p>Lock in your rate before age or health issues make coverage expensive or out of reach.</p>
      <h3>2. It’s About Legacy, Not Just Death</h3>
      <p>Life insurance can be a wealth-building tool. Use it to pay off debt, cover final expenses, or even leave a financial head start for your children.</p>
      <h3>3. It Protects Your Family’s Future</h3>
      <p>If something happened to you, would your loved ones be financially okay? If not, now’s the time to act.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Plan your timeline.</strong> Give yourself (and vendors) enough time for every part of the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose your officiant early.</strong> Book your officiant as soon as possible, especially if you want someone who fits your vibe.</li>
        <li><strong>Rehearse, but stay flexible.</strong> Have a run-through, but remember: little “imperfections” are part of the memories!</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate with your guests.</strong> Let everyone know the schedule and location details in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it personal.</strong> Add small touches—music, readings, traditions—that mean something to you.</li>
      </ol>

      <ul>
        <li>Say no to undercharging.</li>
        <li>Say yes to bigger opportunities.</li>
        <li>Surround yourself with people who believe in you.</li>
